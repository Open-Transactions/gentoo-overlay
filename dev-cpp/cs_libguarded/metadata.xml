    The CsLibGuarded library is a standalone header only library for
    multithreaded programming.

    This library provides templated classes which prevent race conditions by
    controlling access to shared data. Existing multithreading primitives like
    mutexes and locks are only bound to the protected data by conventions. This
    makes it very easy to introduce bugs in your code by forgetting to use the
    right locks before accessing a block of data. The idea of this library is to
    tie the data and the locks in a type safe interface that only allows correct
    usage.
